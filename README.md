## üß† What is PayZoll ?

Payzoll is a **fully modular Web3 payment infrastructure** built to meet the needs of both crypto-native projects and traditional Web2 enterprises.

3. **Compliance & Reporting**  
   Built-in KYC/AML workflows and audit trails ensure you stay on the right side of regulations.

4. **Fiat Settlement**  
   Automatically convert on-chain balances to local currency and settle directly to bank accounts, all with one confirmation.
